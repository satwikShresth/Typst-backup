 My writing has greatly evolved over my education. Upon reflection, I can notice substantial differences in my writing education in school in India versus here at Drexel. The differences in priorities, curriculum, and content have greatly influenced me as a writer and student.
 
In my school in India, we had an English teacher. However, her teaching style always grated on me. She would use her English knowledge as a status symbol, sometimes saying complex sentences with fancy words and not explaining them just so we as students should feel inferior. Looking back, she derived a sense of self-worth and pride from this ridiculous exercise. In some circles in India, knowing a lot of English can be a flex and make you seem more refined or credible, just like a new car or wearing designer shoes. However, she took this to the extreme, entirely forgetting that the purpose of learning a language is to communicate ideas more effectively.

Indian curriculums favor high test scores and obedience. For example, when reading a passage, we are tested about our comprehension and vocabulary, but not at all for interpretation. The right answer was always rewarded, but interpretation and creativity were never a priority. For this reason, my English grades always hovered right in the middle, and I hated my English classes and never wrote unless required to. My priority when writing was always to pass under the radar and get a good grade in as little time as possible. However, I had a healthy reading appetite for fiction, and I recall reading Matilda and Percy Jackson cover-to-cover as a kid. Thankfully, I was able to separate reading from my dislike for writing and nurture my creativity in other ways.

I noticed a significant change in my writing when I enrolled in Drexel and started taking my mandatory English classes my freshman year. The teaching style was significantly different, and therefore better. I took English 101 and 102, with professors Matthew Smith and Karen Nulton. These classes were a way for me to practice my English and writing in a failure-friendly environment. Of course I knew how to speak and write English, but I lacked the confidence and cadence to speak without thinking or to write convincingly. In one of these classes, I had to create a research paper with citations and formal language. This was a challenge because I had to effectively convince someone of something and learn APA formatting. This was the first assignment where I really struggled with the concept of credibility as a writer and how to build it. I doubted my own credibility and how to establish it until the last moment I submitted the assignment.

One very interesting experience I had was my final project about privacy on the internet in Prof. Nulton's class. For the final assignment, I had a fundamental misunderstanding of the project scope. What I submitted was completely off from what she needed and would have been a failing grade. Prof. Nulton told me that what I had submitted was completely wrong and gave me a chance to re-do it and I submitted again. I was very pleasantly surprised when I received a 100% on my resubmission. Never before had I been allowed to fail and try again for such a large project in school. This is because Prof. Nulton valued my learning over seamless perfection and was happy to spend time regrading. My perspective about education was completely changed, because I realized how failure and freedom is such an effective tool for me and therefore others. By gaining confidence in my writing and being able to iterate, I felt more confident about my credibility as a writer and that my work even deserves to be read.

English 103 was completely outside of my comfort zone. My only prior poetry experience was old Hindi fables. My favorite is Rani of Jhansi, a poem about the first female freedom fighter who fought against the East India Company. These types of poems provide a different function to modern Western poetry, they are patriotic calling cards and blur the lines between history, religion, and myth. The poetry we studied in English 103 was written to serve many other functions, like stream-of-consciousness prose, processing emotions, or sharing personal experiences. I was free to interpret each poem as I wanted to and relate it to myself and my ideas and life. There were no wrong answers, only lazy answers.

In this, my own writing has improved when being immersed with excellent writers. Over the course of the term, I have become more fluid and conversational in my sentence structure. I also seek to write descriptively or abstractly. The Dilaudid poem really stuck with me because it was my first experience seeing abstract writing describe an idea better than a literal description could. Taking a lesson from this, I have begun experimenting with more creative ideas and descriptions when possible.

In all of these experiences and classes with various disciplines, goals, and areas of focus, the underlying theme here is practice makes better, but never perfect. I feel that going through such a lousy writing education to a better one has made me appreciate the arts of writing and teaching more. I also now understand that writing is a journey that matures over time. As I continue reading, writing, and appreciating others' writing over my life, I hope to continue to grow in these areas.
