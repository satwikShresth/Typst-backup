Submit this report electronically (by attaching a Microsoft Word document, not a pdf file) to the online course shell by the due date and time indicated on the assignment link. Do not submit any supplemental files, such as Excel workbooks. Do not submit a copy of the report in class. Each team member should have a copy of the report on their laptop AND be familiar with all aspects of the case, so they can participate in the class discussion. I will return the graded cases online within one week after submission.

#underline[Important Guidelines Regarding Plagiarism]

Your work on the case reports must be original. In addition, it should be based on only the information provided in the case. The cases are based on real companies. I strongly encourage you not to try to “get the right answer” by searching the internet for additional facts or information about what happened to the company after the date of the case. There is no “right answer” to the case. Your grade will be based on how well you analyze the data in the case and support your recommendations. Solutions to most cases exist online. If any material from another source is used in a case report, all students in the group will receive a zero for the case, and the incident will be reported to the University Office of Student Conduct. If your name is on a report, you assume responsibility for its content.

  They found out about Jared’s pitch through a bit of luck. They discover Vennett’s pitch by finding a presentation he accidentally left in the lobby of a large investment bank. This presentation detailed the opportunity to short the housing market using credit default swaps and was able to get their interest. They needed an ISDA because without it they would not be able to trade derivative products or swaps. Basically, it is an agreement that allows parties to trade derivative products like credit default swaps. Charlie and Jamie needed an ISDA agreement to be able to trade these financial instruments directly with large investment banks. Essentially, the ISDA is a gateway for accessing the market for credit default swaps, enabling them to place their bets against the housing market.

]

#quote(

  As portrayed in the movie, Mark Baum was a skeptic who did not accept anything at face value. He would access and question every single aspect and parties involved. His research played an important role in uncovering the truth behind the facade.
]

- Baum’s team traveled to neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates to speak directly with homeowners. They discovered that many borrowers did not fully understand the terms of their adjustable-rate mortgages and were unaware of the impending increase in their monthly payments

- They found that the system was being blatantly gamed. They uncovered instances where people were obtaining mortgages using fraudulent information, due to the lack of scrutiny by banks

- Baum then uncovers the extent to which the financial market was reliant on the housing sector. He found that a significant portion of financial products, including synthetic MBS, were derived from the housing market and were being sold in massive quantities

#quote(

  Mark Baum\'s research and his methodology played a major role, he focused on this ground level research and did not conclude it by talking to just one of the parties involved, but with every single participant involved in the ecosystem. This rigorous method allowed Baum to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to significant profits as the market collapsed.

  + Why were synthetic CDO’s important ? (Kyle)
]

#quote(
  block: true,
)[
  Synthetic CDOs highlight the extent of the housing bubble before the 2008 financial crisis. As explained in \"The Big Short\", synthetic CDOs are essentially bets on the performance of a mortgage bond. Surprisingly, the synthetic CDOs consist of other CDOs or other synthetic CDOs, amplifying their risk. If the underlying mortgage bonds contained in a synthetic CDO default, the synthetic CDO becomes worthless. In the context of the movie, the synthetic CDOs are important because once Mark Baum learned about synthetic CDOs and how much market value is in the synthetic CDO market, he realized the immense potential profit from the credit default swaps his company held.

  + Who is the Least impressive Market participant or Regulator in the movie? Why? (Kyle)
]

#quote(
  block: true,
)[
  The least impressive market participant in “The Big Short” is Wing Chau, portrayed by Byron Mann. Wing Chau is the CDO manager who was having dinner with Mark Baum and disclosed details on CDOs and how they are utilized in the mortgage market. Specifically, the movie portrayed Wing Chau to be conceited, narcissistic, and greedy. Objectively, Wing Chau’s CDOs, especially the synthetic CDOs, were catalysts for the collapse of the housing market and the 2008 financial crisis. These high-risk CDOs became worthless during the financial crisis, causing widespread financial damage for a lot of people. Wing Chau’s involvement in promoting synthetic CDOs made a significant contribution to the housing market bubble and helped make the financial crisis worse than it would have already been in 2008, making him a particularly unimpressive market participant.

]

#quote(
  block: true,
)[
  The most impressive character in the movie was Dr. Michael Burry, portrayed by Christian Bale. Dr. Burry\'s research and early identification of the impending housing market collapse demonstrate his exceptional analytical skills. He conducted research about the mortgage data, identifying the unsustainable nature of the subprime mortgage market well before anyone else. Despite skepticism and opposition, he maintained strong conviction in his analysis and took the bold step of betting against the housing market. His patience and resilience were tested and ultimately showed that his analysis was correct. Dr. Burry’s foresight and conviction make him a standout character in the movie.

  + How has the movie improved your understanding of the interaction between Regulators and Financial Industry? Three main takeaways. (Ali)
]

#quote(block: true)[
  Takeaways:
]

- The movie highlights how regulatory bodies like the SEC failed to effectively monitor and regulate the financial industry. The SEC\'s inability to identify and address the growing risks in the mortgage market allowed financial institutions to engage in reckless behaviour, contributing to the eventual crisis. If the SEC was there to stop financial institutions from taking such risks the crisis could have prevented

- The film underscores the conflicts of interest that can arise within the financial system, particularly with credit rating agencies. Since these agencies needed to maintain business relationships with the banks that issued the securities, they often gave favourable ratings to risky mortgage-backed securities, which essentially created the crisis.

- The main takeaway from the movie was the importance of communication between financial institutions and regulators. Throughout the crisis, the flow of information and the transparency of communication were crucial for both parties. The film shows how miscommunication and lack of transparency can lead to financial instability.

  + If your team were responsible in 2006/2007 for the regulatory construct governing banking (at Federal Reserve / US Treasury / FDIC). Which three rules would you suggest which could have helped in maybe either reducing the financial crisis which happened or even preempt it? Explain. satwik

    #block[
      #set enum(numbering: "a.", start: 1)
      + The fundamental problem identified by both Michael Burry and Mark Baum was the prevalence of bad lending practices. Burry was able to predict the crisis by analysing the loans bundled in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and foreseeing the wave of defaults that would follow.

        #block[
          #set enum(numbering: "i.", start: 1)
          + Enforce rigorous background checks and income verification for all mortgage applicants.

            - Banks must thoroughly verify the financial stability and repayment capability of borrowers before issuing loans.

            - This includes verifying income, employment status, credit history, and existing debt obligations.

          + Impose larger risk-weighted assets for riskier loans

            - Some loans were clearly riskier than others due to lower credit scores or unstable income sources.

            - In all of these scenarios banks must hold a high percent of the loan as a buffer with the Federal Reserve

            - These additional capital requirement ensures that banks are better prepared to absorb potential losses from defaults

            - It also discourages bank from giving out riskier loans

          + Open source credit rating mathematical models

            - One of the major factor in the crisis was credit rating agencies not being truthful in their ratings due to business pressures

            - I will create a team to develop an well documented open-source mathematical model that can provide a transparent and reliable baseline for rating financial instruments

            - Since its open-source general public and other financial institutions can read, fork or help further develop the open-source model under the supervision of government agencies

            - Credit rating companies cannot rate any securities above or below a standard deviation, without proper explanation and mathematical proof.
