My name is Satwik Shresth, and I am a senior at the College of Computing & Informatics (CCI) pursuing a degree in computer science. Growing up in a small town in India where computers were often viewed as a distraction from studies, I found myself increasingly fascinated by them. I had so many questions about how it works. How does the computer understand english? How is it able to do arithmetic? How did they make game characters move,etc. These were very difficult questions for my parents or teachers to answer. The lack of answers to an increasing number of questions deepened the enigma around computers, fueling my intrigue. 

Over the last three years at Drexel, I have learned multiple programming languages & paradigms, developer tools & skills while maintaining a strong academic record. This allowed me to build a strong foundation that has enabled me to pursue other interests like photography, traveling, hiking and cooking.

I have completed two co-ops, where I was able to experience contributing complex real-world software solutions. Additionally, I have assisted numerous of my peers as a Teaching Assistant at CCI, guiding and tutoring them through their coursework.

I have had the opportunity to work in two different fields as a software engineer. My first co-op was with OPEX Corporation, a warehouse automation and robotics firm specializing in building robots for sorting, storage and retrieval of warehousing products. As a developer, I worked on the client facing application, improving the user interface and efficient communication between the host machine and the robot.

In my second co-op, I worked at Susquehanna International Group, a high frequency trading firm that trades options and futures on all major exchanges around the world. I worked on building a new software to collect metrics from a large volume of incoming and outgoing messages (4 billion messages daily), and engineering a solution around it to allow clients to visualize the data. Apart from projects, my responsibilities included documentation, managing tickets, reporting bugs, code review and design discussions. These are common everyday tasks for software engineers across various fields.

I was very active in community service up until my freshman year. I used to regularly participate in neighborhood cleaning drives around north Philadelphia, nature walks with locals, volunteer kitchen duties at Hindu temple in Germantown etc, but now my involvement has decreased due to other more important obligations. As a senior, my community service has been relegated to helping out my peers during office hours and open-source contributions to discussions and source code.

My experience in writing has primarily consisted of creating documentation for code bases and instructions to use a developer tool. The most recent substantial piece of writing I did was an article that I wrote for the ENGL 102 course in my sophomore year. Interestingly, Professor Nulton appreciated my writer’s logs more than the article itself and recommended that I take “WRIT 303: Writing Humor and Comedy”, to flesh out my potential to be a better comedic writer.

My strengths in writing would be that I am able to find a clear direction to move the context and apprehend the feelings of the reader, setting the right tone for the passage. However, I tend to overcomplicate the sentences trying to add more context than necessary, which overwhelms the reader. I often struggle maintaining the right cadence, making sentences choppy.
