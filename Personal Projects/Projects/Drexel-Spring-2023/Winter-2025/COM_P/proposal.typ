== Project Proposal: Open Mario
#v(-4pt)
== Overview

Open Mario is an innovative information sharing platform designed specifically for the Drexel students. This centralized database enables students to access and contribute to a growing repository of course reviews, academic notes, schedules, salary information, co-op experiences, and interview insights transforming individual student experiences into collective knowledge that benefits all.

== Purpose

Open Mario addresses three key challenges for Drexel students:

-  limited course visibility before registration
- difficulty finding suitable co-op opportunities
- salary expectation uncertainty 
 
By facilitating peer-to-peer knowledge sharing, the platform helps students make more informed decisions about their academic paths and co-op selections while providing valuable salary insights. This collaborative approach not only improves individual decision making..


== Market Demand

The demand for Open Mario is clearly demonstrated by the significant student engagement with existing informal solutions such as Reddit discussions and Discord communities, despite their inherent limitations of fragmented information and unstructured data.

Our platform directly addresses these shortcomings by providing a centralized repository with organized, verified content specifically tailored to Drexel University's distinctive Co-op program and academic structure.

== Introduction

Drexel University's Co-op program offers students invaluable real-world experience, yet this opportunity comes with significant challenges. The lack of transparency around co-op salaries, interview processes, and student experiences creates disadvantages for students making important academic and career decisions. 

Currently, students navigate this landscape with severely limited resources to evaluate fair compensation, prepare effectively for interviews, or gain meaningful insights into potential roles, companies, courses, or instructors. While Drexelâ€™s career services provide aggregated salary data, the lack of detailed, company-specific salary information limits students' ability to make fully informed decisions about compensation and career opportunities.

Research indicates that pay transparency policies, particularly those offering cross-firm salary information, significantly empower job seekers by guiding them toward higher-paying employers. Such transparency often leads to increased negotiation power, higher salaries, better employee motivation, and overall productivity improvements (Cullen, 2023). 

This proposal introduces "Open Mario", an open-source platform dedicated to disrupting this status quo by enabling anonymous information sharing. The platform transforms isolated experiences into collective wisdom, ensuring each generation of Drexel students benefits from those who came before.

This document outlines the platform's targeted audience, key features, market analysis, challenge assessment and metrics for success.

== Market Analysis

#v(-3pt)
=== Current Landscape

The demand for Open Mario is supported by clear evidence:
- A popular Reddit thread with approximately 230 salary submissions and 17,000+ views shows significant student engagement
- Lack of any dedicated platform for students to share academic and career-related information
- Limited publicly available data for position-specific details and fair compensation comparisons
- Existing unofficial rating systems that don't integrate course reviews with workload information
