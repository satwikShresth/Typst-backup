 _Dilaudid_ by Lynn Levin is written about the author’s experience being on her deathbed and being administered Dilaudid, an opiate painkiller. The first line, so small I almost missed it, says _“Timor mortis conturbat me”_. I had to look it up, it means, the “pain of death disturbs me” in Latin. Evidently, this phrase has appeared in many poems over many years, creating a history of and meaning its own. There’s a special irony in writing about a fear of death in Latin,  a language that’s functionally dead with no conversational speakers. This text is written in italics to denote that it has special meaning, as something to keep in mind before experiencing the rest of the poem. 

The first stanza sets the stage, describing the experience being on her deathbed, being given the drug, and how it eased her pain. She describes the sensation as “Dilaudid knocked me back to the black cat’s fur, time spilt its ink, and the dark prince took me on my narrow hospital gurney. All was fathoms.” This is very vivid imagery for something that should be very straightforward. A painkiller should just remove pain, right? However, the drug Dilaudid seems to have had an incredible effect on the author. She uses vivid imagery, like falling onto the fur of a black cat, and time having ink. Of course, these are all impossible things that cannot exist in reality while being described in the English language. Time does not have ink, and she was on a hospital bed the whole time, not ppthe fur of a black cat. Clearly, the author is describing an out-of-body transformative extrasensory experience. The way her experiences are described, it feels as though she experienced each of these things in slow-motion, with time enough to appreciate the beauty of these sensations. I am even envious of the author, as I wish to have such an incredible experience as well.

The second stanza is the recovery, the coming back to center. She hears the nurses making small talk, and makes the difficult decision not to take another dose. She called Dilaudid “the hero drug”. However, she makes a choice not to ask the nurses for it again even though they would have obliged and administered the drug. The author  confronts reality and lets the idea of death disturb her once again. Finally, She equates days to plums on a tree, and young people to those with countless plums to pick from. She can no longer pick from the plum tree on a whim, and envies other people. The fear of death has arrived and disturbed her. The first sentence of the poem, “Timor mortis conturbat me” has come true. The author has a fear of death, as should the reader as well. 

The first and second stanzas have very different tones. The first stanza is very abstract and artistic. This helps the reader understand the incredible effect of the drug. The second stanza is more pained, more realistic. We feel her pain, both physical and the mental pain of being in pain again after not being in pain. From this, we can infer a sense of change. The experience, being in the hospital for whatever reason it was and then being put on Dilaudid, has changed the author. She is now permanently closer to death, and it disturbs her. As the reader, I get the sense that she will not be the same again even after she recovers and leaves this hospital.

The poem structure is prose. The author is recounting something that happened in the past, so this is not quite a stream-of-consciousness style, but rather feels like a conversation between loved ones or a private diary entry.  For this reason, the poem functions as a word of warning. She is warning us not to be tempted by “the dark prince”, Dilaudid. The name she chooses to describe Dilaudid, the dark prince, brings connotations of royalty or a dark figure, the kind that haunted our bedroom closets at night. Dilaudid is a prince because the Dilaudid is in control, like royalty given the divine right to rule. Dilaudid is the dark prince because it has ulterior motives, as though Dilaudid will remove pain but at a much steeper and hidden price. Given this prose style and powerful descriptions, I feel like the author is looking me directly in the eyes and warning me not to listen to the dark prince and avoid painkillers like Dilaudid at whatever cost. 
 

The final emotional punchline is the title of the poem, one single word: Dilaudid. Dilaudid has a painful history. One google search shows that many people are addicted to this powerful drug, as it's an opiate. There are resource guides and cautionary tales mixed into the search results. The author is clearly thinking about these stories when she makes the choice to refuse a second dose, accepting her reality of pain and fear of death, timor mortis. 


Levin’s Dilaudid is a powerful meditation on the intersection of pain, mortality, and temptation. Through vivid and almost surreal imagery, the first stanza immerses the reader in an altered state of consciousness, a moment where pain dissipates, and the world bends in unimaginable ways. Then, with an abrupt shift, the second stanza pulls us back into reality, where she listens to nurses chatting and remembers being back in a hospital, where the choice to resist Dilaudid becomes a defining moment of self-awareness. The initial Latin phrase, Timor mortis conturbat me, lingers, reinforcing the weight of the author’s fear and the reader’s own inevitable confrontation with mortality. The dark prince Dilaudid is both savior and sinister force, offering fleeting relief at an immeasurable cost: addiction. The poem, with its raw honesty and prose-like structure, is not just a recounting of an experience but a warning, urging the reader to resist the seductive pull of escape via opiates and face the reality of suffering head-on. We must let the fear of death disturb us- Timor mortis conturbat me, but not control us. Awareness of death is healthy, but a paralyzed fear of death would give death just as much control over us as the Dilaudid.
