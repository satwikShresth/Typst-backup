== Introduction
\
#v(-20pt)
I still remember my first day in the United States. I ordered an Uber, and a Tesla car pulled up to pick me from the airport. I had never been in a self-driving car before, so out of curiosity, I asked the Uber driver to turn on the autopilot mode. The car started cruising through the streets all by itself. The steering wheel rotated as if the car was possessed. This experience sparked my interest in learning more about the fields of computer vision and advanced reasoning machine learning models. Little did I know that one day I would be talking to someone involved in the development of this impressive technology.

This past week, I had the privilege of interviewing Yash Kishore, former Senior Product Manager in Tesla's Autopilot AI team. This interview assignment was the perfect opportunity to understand more about his journey and seek career advice for the future.

== Professional Background and Work Environment
\
#v(-20pt)

Yash has an unconventional career path, most product managers have software or business experience, but his journey started as a mechanical engineer intern at Tesla. He drafted designs for battery packs needed for Tesla Model X. All his ideas and designs, once accepted, were handed off to another team that oversaw the manufacturing. Yash got curious about what would happen to his designs. This curiosity drove him to contact his Program Manager to oversee the full product development process.

Under his Program Manager's guidance, Yash gained comprehensive exposure to the entire product lifecycle. He first learned about the conceptualization stage, then studied supply chain management, and finally understood the validation stage, where items are tested and refined. Through this journey, Yash developed enthusiasm for product management, which guided him toward a career in the field.

After this experience, Yash broadened his expertise in tech product development, gained pitching skills for startups, and secured an internship at Google working on their Google Home hardware team before returning to Tesla as a product manager. He is currently building an Automated Revenue System (ARS) at a Bay Area startup.

== The Role of Communication in Technology Leadership
\
#v(-20pt)

There were many valuable insights about communication in the technology field worth adopting. One of which I would consider to be "technical bilingualism" the capacity to interact successfully with both end users and engineers. This skill was very evident when talking with Yash. Throughout our conversation, I was able to follow everything he explained despite having little to no background knowledge about the technologies he has worked with. His ability to provide sufficient context before diving into technical details was exceptional.

Yash also highlighted that effective communication follows the "less is more" principle. By identifying exactly what information needs to be conveyed to each audience, he avoids overwhelming them with irrelevant details.
He made an interesting point about end users: even tech enthusiasts typically have only surface level knowledge of implementation details. The product manager's role is not what most developers assume. It is about translating complex technical concepts into language that business and marketing teams can understand and act upon.

== Evaluating and Pursuing New Ideas
\
#v(-20pt)

One of the questions I asked him was 

_How do you know if an idea is worth pursuing?_

To which Yash replied that any promising idea must be backed by thorough research and strong customer feedback. Further, he clarified that decisions cannot be based merely on gut feeling or a small survey. A radically new product idea needs to go through many stages just like a startup - the only difference being that we already have a financial backer (Tesla). However, this is also a drawback because we cannot go to another interested party. 

I felt he restrained from discussing the specific stages of idea development used at Tesla and focused more on sharing his personal approach to ideation. Yash also recommended an article on #link("https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-design-thinking")[_Design Thinking_] and a book called _Will It Fly by Pat Flynn_.

== Personal Impact
\
#v(-20pt)

Yash's experience in the tech industry for nearly six years provided insights that transcend typical career advice. He motivated me to believe that there is more to a person than their GPA and more to the world than classrooms. He emphasized that there is no single formula for success; all you need is desire and courage to pursue your dreams.

He mentioned that while interning at Google, he was surrounded by people from local institutions, state colleges, and Ivy League universities. They came from various backgrounds, cultures, and countries. The one thing that united them all was their passion for their field and eagerness to learn more. I found his perspectives very convincing. As a software engineer, I have often been myopic, focusing solely on implementation details without considering the product's wider impact or end users. This conversation was much needed, and I feel inspired to explore more of what this industry has to offer.

== Follow-up Plans
#v(13pt)

For future research, I would be interested in:

- Advanced reasoning models driving the self-balancing capabilities of SpaceX rockets
- Advanced computer vision technologies that leverage machine learning models used in autonomous cars instead of alternative methods

In the future, I would be interested in:

- Reach out to more product managers within tech companies to gain diverse perspectives
- Connect with professionals who have successfully transitioned from development roles to product management

== Conclusion
\
#v(-20pt)

This interview has provided me with valuable insights not only about Tesla's work culture, but also about career advancement in the tech industry. The most impactful lessons were the importance of authenticity, maintaining curiosity, and finding joy in one's work. As Yash emphasized, pursuing one's dreams requires passion and courage; there is no single formula for success.

This conversation has been more than just an academic exercise, it has been a transformative experience that has reshaped my understanding of product development. I am happy to walk away with a clearer perspective on how to approach my career path and the importance of developing both technical and communication skills to succeed in this industry.
