== Theory Answers
1. If you had the opportunity to ask Vint one thing what would that be?
  - I would ask Vint about the future of Internet Governance. With rapid advancements in technology and the increasing digitization of society, what key principles do you think should guide the future development ? Specifically, how can we balance innovation with security and privacy concerns in a way that fosters trust on a global scale?
  
2. What is one thing of interest you took away from this video?
  - One interesting thing pointed out by Vint was the importance of standards. He mentioned the initial skepticism faced by the TCP/IP protocol suite and how it eventually became the foundational technology for the modern internet. This highlights the idea that standards should not be static but should evolve to meet changing technological needs and challenges. Comparing this to current standards of TCP/IP, we can see that while the core protocols remain largely unchanged, there have been updates and extensions to address new requirements such as IPv6 for addressing limitations of IPv4 and improvements in security protocols like TLS for enhanced data protection.
