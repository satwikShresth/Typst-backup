I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at Applied Intuition, which I discovered on your careers page. I am inspired by your commitment to accelerating the adoption of safe and intelligent machines and by your innovative approach to developing AI-powered ADAS/AD toolchains and autonomy stacks.

As someone passionate about technology, mathematics, and computer science, I’m excited to bring my enthusiasm and fresh perspective to your team. My experience in developing robust, mission-critical software has prepared me to tackle complex challenges in the autonomy space. I believe my energy and eagerness to learn make me a strong fit for this role, and I look forward to growing alongside experts in shaping the future of intelligent vehicles.

In my recent role at an HFT firm, I developed high-performance systems to enhance data throughput and reduce processing times. For instance, I created a C++ tool that could parse billions of daily transactions to collect metrics and hydrate Elasticsearch database cluster, enabling multiple teams to track trading activity and monitor the health of trading systems in real-time.

Additionally, I developed a concurrent Kafka client in Python using complex C libraries, enabling security teams with limited development experience to process over 500 million messages in under five minutes, allowing efficient monitoring of data inconsistencies and security vulnerabilities, and significantly reducing the overhead of external dependencies.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring this blend of technical expertise and collaborative experience to Applied Intuition. I am confident that my background aligns well with the demands of this role, and I am eager to contribute to projects that drive the future of safe, intelligent machines. I look forward to discussing how my experience and ambitions match Applied Intuition’s vision and how I can be an asset to your innovative team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
